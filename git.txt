linux->open source *git 
 It was developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005.
Git works on command line(CLI).
-git -v (for checking the version)
SVN, Mercurial, etc are the competitors

What is Git?
Git is an open-source software and a distributed version control system (DVCS) used to track changes in source code during software development. It is installed locally on a developer's system and supports features like branching, merging, and versioning, enabling efficient collaboration. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git is now maintained by The Linux Foundation.

what is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-hosted platform, acquired by Microsoft in 2018. It provides Git functionality such as version control (VCS), source code management (SCM), and tools for collaboration. Developers use GitHub to manage, track, and collaborate on code effectively.

What is a git repository?
A repository is a file structure where git stores all the project-based files. Git can either stores the files on the local or the remote repository.

local vs remote repository?
->A local repository is a copy of your project's files and version history stored on your computer, where you can make changes, stage files, and commit updates independently. 
->A remote repository, on the other hand, is a shared copy hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub or GitLab). It allows others to access and collaborate on your project over the internet by pulling changes or pushing updates.

What is the git push command?
The 'git push' command is used to share local repository changes to a remote repository.

What is a 'conflict' in git?
Git usually manages merges automatically, but conflicts occur when two branches edit the same line



What is the purpose of the .gitignore file?
The '.gitignore' file tells Git which files and folders to ignore when tracking changes. It is used to avoid attaching unneeded files (like logs, temporary files, or compiled code) to your repository.

10. What is a version control system (VCS)?


	Feature				Git (DVCS)			SVN (CVCS)
Repository Storage		Distributed (local copy)	Centralized (central server)
Offline Work			Supported			Limited
Performance			Faster (local operations)	Slower (network dependency)
Branching & Merging		Efficient and lightweight	Heavier and slower

-ls
List the Directory

-git config --global user.name manikamaraj
git config are used to set up global configurations for Git on your system

-git config --global user.email manikamaraj@gmail.com
git config are used to set up global configurations for Git on your system

-git config --global http.sslVerify false

-mkdir git-practice
Creates a new directory named git-practice.

-cd git-practice
cd(change directory) is used to move to next path.(move forward).

-cd ..
move backward

-git init
Initializes an empty Git repository in the current directory. A hidden .git folder is created, which contains metadata and tracking information.

-git init -b mani
It Initialize an empty git repository with branch name.

git status
Displays the current status of your working directory, showing untracked, staged, and committed files.

git add demo.txt
stages all changes in particular working directory?

-git branch
it show the what are the branches you have!(Lists all branches in your repository)

-git branch --all
it show the local and remote branch

-git branch new_name
it will create the new branch

-git branch -d branchname
delete the branch

-git checkout new_name
it will change the branch

-git add .
Stages all changes in the working directory, including new files, modifications, and deletions.

-git commit -m 'First commit'

-git remote add origin https://github.com/MANIKANDAN-IT21/Empty.git

-git push -u origin master

-git pull

-git log
It provides detailed information about previous commits.
Commit hash (unique ID).
Author of the commit.
Date and time of the commit.
Commit message.

-git clone ____

-git diff(working directory)
it show the what are changes you are made now(it show the particular line and was changed)

-git diff -staged (staging side)
it show the what are changes you are made now(it show the particular line and was changed)

-echo "hello world" >> README.md
it is create the readme file and with some content.

-cat README.md
it will show the content in the README file

-git checkout branch
branch switching, file restoration(like undo)

-git switch branch
it just switching the branch

-git tag (commonly used to assign the version number, Tags are immutable,)
In tag concept we have 2 tag
1. light weight tag
git tag v1.0
2. annotation tag (-a is the annotation)
git tag -a v1.0 -m "First stable release"

-git merge branch2
first your shount go to main branch
-git checkout master
then
